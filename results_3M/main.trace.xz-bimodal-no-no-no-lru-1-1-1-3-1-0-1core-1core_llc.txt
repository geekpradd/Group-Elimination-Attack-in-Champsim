Demonstration of GE Algorithm 
First Index of Packet being missed is: 0
Thus for this packet, there are enough packets in our set that can evict this particular data packet
We will find a minimal set of WAY = 16 packets that will evict this packet using GE

Thus for address 2031101097678270949 the eviction set is 
4571218233983138667

Now we will prove that this set is indeed an eviction set. For this we will first the target and then read all these addresses, pushing them into the cache.
Then we hit target at the end and see that its a miss, implying that it got evicted.
Then we will read target again, and then cyclically go through the set, checking for a hit and then reading it. If all WAY+1 of these addresses belong to the same set, we must see misses for each address as reading the previous address will cause the next one to be evicted due to LRU policy

Missed Target! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 0! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 1! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 2! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 3! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 4! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 5! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 6! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 7! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 8! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 9! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 10! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 11! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 12! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 13! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 14! This means it got evicted!
Missed Address at index 15! This means it got evicted!
This verifies that we indeed got the eviction set
